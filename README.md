## Description

It also uses React components, and has a GraphQL API. It is deployed using Heroku with a MongoDB Atlas database. Modular design for the front end allows for easy expansion of the site. The site is responsive and works on mobile devices. The site is also accessible to screen readers. The site is also optimized for search engines. Modulization allows for easy redeployment for use in other ecomerce sites.

Coded with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, React, MongoDB, Mongoose, GraphQL, and Heroku.
